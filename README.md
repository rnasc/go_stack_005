[Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br)  is a brazilian tech trainning company stablished in Santa Catarina (Brazil).
They are focused on teaching and trainning professionals in the Node JS based stacks.

## Go Stack
This is Rocketseat's approach to forming new full-stack developers. By full stack what's meant is: Developers
with skills and habilities on all the stacks required for web and mobile software development. 

To achieve this, their belief is to simplify by using technologies with the same computer language
as its roots: Javascript. This is possible by the development of the NodeJS enviroment and comunity.
Also given the available tools:
- Typescript
- React
- React Native

## Challenges
During the trainning we are challenged to create solutions in the form of exercises and make them public.
This way we can get the community feedback in case some approach could be improved (or if some error or
issue is found).

## Be my guest
So, please be my guest to check the code here and suggest improvements, point out defects, and code
together.
